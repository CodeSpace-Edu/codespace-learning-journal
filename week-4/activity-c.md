# Activity C: Javascript Vocabulary Flashcards üóÇÔ∏è

## Objective: This low-effort activity will help you with memorization and quick recall of Javascript terms.

### Instructions: üìÉ

1. **Preparation:** Create a set of flashcards with Javascript terms. There's no need to get fancy, these can be written on simple scraps of paper. Write the term on one side of the card and its definition and a brief example of its usage on the other side. You can start with around 20-30 terms, including things like "Variable", "Array", "Function", "Object", etc.

2. **Study Session:** Spend 10-15 minutes each day reviewing these flashcards. Shuffle the cards each time to vary the order. 

3. **Testing:** Test yourself by looking at the term and trying to recall the definition and example. Flip the card to check if you were correct.

4. **Progressive Learning:** Once you're comfortable with the initial set of terms, add more cards to your deck. 

Sharing: If you're learning in a group, you can turn this into a fun game. One person shows the term, and the others compete to give the correct definition and example. 

This activity requires minimal effort but will substantially improve your understanding and recall of Javascript vocabulary. It is flexible and can be easily adjusted to fit your pace of learning.
